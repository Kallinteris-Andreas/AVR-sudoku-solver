**HRY411 - Semester Project**

26 November:
Simulation with "simulation_26_11.stim" (feeds AVR with the sudoku given in the assignment)
Commands AT, C, N, and P work fine
The sudoku was solved successfully (started on 297331.7 usec and ended on 322455.7 usec).
More tests tomorrow (sending the results back is not tested, they are simply written correctly to SRAM).
